ASE ecosystem
=============

This is a list of software packages related to ASE or using ASE.
These could well be of interest to ASE users in general.
If you know of a project which
should be listed here, but isn't, please open a merge request adding
link and descriptive paragraph.

Listed in alphabetical order, for want of a better approach.

   matscipy is a generic materials science toolbox built around ASE.
   It provides useful routines for plasticity and dislocations, fracture
   mechanics, electro-chemistry, tribology, and elastic properties.
   In addition to domain-specific routines, it also implements a set of
   general-purpose, low-level utilities such as efficient neighbour lists.

 * `NequIP <https://github.com/mir-group/nequip>`_:
   Euclidian Equivariant neural network potentials.  Nequip can fit
   neural network potentials to series of DFT calculations (using
   e.g. ASE trajectory files), and then be used to perform
   optimization and molecular dynamics in ASE or LAMMPS.
